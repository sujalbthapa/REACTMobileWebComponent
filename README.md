**User Registration**
Employees and clients can easily register with the Knowledge Management System. Upon launching the application, users click the sign-up button and select their user type. The system then prompts them to enter details, choose a unique username, and set a password. After clicking the register button, a success message is displayed. In case of a duplicate username, the system guides the user to choose another.

**User Login**
Initiated by both employees and clients, the login process involves launching the application, clicking the login button, and providing valid credentials. Upon successful validation, the system displays a login success message. In case of validation failure, a user-friendly error message guides the user to re-enter the correct credentials.

**User Logout**
Users can seamlessly log out of the system by clicking the logout button, prompting the system to display a successful logout message.
